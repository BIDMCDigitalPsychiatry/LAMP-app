<h1>Ti.Healthkit.WorkoutEvent</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>You can use workout events to toggle a workout object between an active and an inactive state. Workouts start in an active state. A pause event switches it to an inactive state; a resume event switches it back to an active state. Adding a pause event when the workout is already inactive, or a resume event when the workout is already active, does not affect the workout's state. These events are ignored.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
