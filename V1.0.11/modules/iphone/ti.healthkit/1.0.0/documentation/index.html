<li>sampleFilters (Object): A dictionary whose keys are OBJECT_TYPE_* constants, and whose values are <a href="filter.html">Ti.Healthkit.Filter</a> instances. The query iterates over all the samples in the correlation. For each sample, it looks up the corresponding filter based on the sample's type and then evaluates that filter against the sample. If the dictionary does not contain a matching sample type, the query accepts the sample. Three things must be true if this query is going to match a correlation:<ul>
<li>The correlation object must match the provided filter parameter.</li>
<li>For each key in the sample filter dictionary, the correlation must contain a sample whose type matches the key. In other words, the keys from the sample filter dictionary define the set of required samples for the correlation.</li>
<li>For each sample in the correlation, use the sample's type to look up its filter in the sample filter dictionary. If the dictionary contains a matching filter, the sample must match that filter. If the dictionary does not contain a matching filter, the sample is ignored (it can have any value).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>onCompletion (Function): Called when the query is completed. It receives the following parameters:<ul>
<li>results (Array of <a href="correlation.html">Ti.Healthkit.Correlation</a> objects): An array containing the correlations returned by this query, or undefined if an error occurred.</li>

<h3>&lt;Ti.Healthkit.ObserverQuery&gt; createObserverQuery(params)</h3>
<p>Creates a new <a href="observerQuery.html">Ti.Healthkit.ObserverQuery</a> object.</p>
<p>After instantiating the query, call the <code>executeQuery</code> function to run it. Observer queries are long-running tasks. They continue to run on a background thread and call their update handler whenever they detect relevant changes to the HealthKit store. To stop a query, call the <code>stopQuery</code> function.</p>
<p>The provided update callback is called every time samples matching this query are saved to or deleted from the HealthKit store. You often need to launch other queries from inside this function to get the updated data. In particular, you can use anchored object queries to retrieve the list of new samples that have been added to the store.</p>
<ul>
<li>params (Object): A dictionary with the following parameters:<ul>
<li>type (String): The type of sample to search for. Use one of the OBJECT_TYPE_* constants.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>&lt;void&gt; callObserverQueryCompletionHandler(completionToken)</h3>
<p>If you have registered for background updates, you must call this function as soon as you are done processing the incoming data. This tells HealthKit that you have successfully received the background update. </p>
<ul>
<li>completionToken (Number): The token received by the <code>onUpdate</code> callback of the observer query.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&lt;Ti.Healthkit.SampleQuery&gt; createSampleQuery(params)</h3>
<p>Creates a new <a href="sampleQuery.html">Ti.Healthkit.SampleQuery</a> object.</p>

</ul>
<h3>&lt;Ti.Healthkit.StatisticsCollectionQuery&gt; createStatisticsCollectionQuery(params)</h3>
<p>Creates a new <a href="statisticsCollectionQuery.html">Ti.Healthkit.StatisticsCollectionQuery</a> object to perform the specified calculations over a set of time intervals.</p>
<p>After you instantiate the query, call the <code>executeQuery</code> function to run it. As soon as the query is complete, the initial results handler is executed.</p>
<p>If you provide an <code>onStatisticsUpdate</code> callback, the statistics collection query will continue to monitor the HealthKit store after gathering the initial results. The statistics update handler is called every time a matching sample is saved to the HealthKit Store.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you do provide an <code>onStatisticsUpdate</code> callback, you must cancel the query by calling the <code>stopQuery</code> function.</p>
<ul>
<li>params (Object): A dictionary with the following parameters:<ul>

<li>anchorDate (Date): The date used to anchor the collection's time intervals. Use this parameter to set the start time for your time intervals. For example, if you are using a day interval, you might create a date object with a time of 2:00 a.m. This value sets the start of the day for each of your time intervals.
    Technically, the anchor sets the start time for a single time interval. All other time intervals must align with this interval. The time intervals can extend before or after the anchor date. Each time interval has the same length, and there is no gap between adjacent intervals. Think of time as a number line: The anchor date represents its origin, with the intervals creating tick marks that extend away from the origin in both directions.</li>
<li>interval (Number): The time interval for each statistics object in the collection, measured in seconds.</li>
<li>onInitialResults (Function): The results handler callback function for this query's initial results. The function will receive the following parameters:<ul>

</ul>
<h3>&lt;Number&gt; getAuthorizationStatusForType(typeString)</h3>
<p>Returns the authorization status of the app for saving the specified data type.
See AUTH_STATUS_* constants for possible values.</p>
<p>To help prevent possible leaks of sensitive health information, your app cannot determine whether or not a user has granted permission to read data. If you are not given permission, it simply appears as if there is no data of the requested type in the HealthKit store. If your app is given share permission but not read permission, you see only the data that your app has written to the store. Data from other sources remains hidden.</p>
<ul>
<li>typeString (String): A string representing an object type. See the OBJECT_TYPE_* constants for possible values.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&lt;Void&gt; requestAuthorization(params)</h3>
<p>Request permission to save and read the specified data types.</p>
<p>This is an async function. If you call this function with a new data type (a type of data that the user has not previously granted or denied permission for in this app), the system automatically displays the permission form, listing all the requested permissions. After the user has finished responding, the callback function provided in the <code>onCompletion</code> parameter is called. If the user has already chosen to grant or prohibit access to all of the types specified, the callback is called without prompting the user.</p>
<p>Each data type has two separate permissions, one to read the data and one to share the data. Typically, you want to request permission for all the data your app needs at one time.</p>
<p>You can customize the messages displayed on the permissions sheet by setting the following keys in your app's info.plist file. Set the NSHealthShareUsageDescription key to customize the message for reading data. Set the NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription key to customize the message for writing data.</p>
<ul>
<li>params (Object): A dictionary with the following parameters:<ul>
<li>typesToShare (Array of Strings): String(s) representing the object type(s) this you want to share. See the OBJECT_TYPE_* constants for possible values.</li>
<li>typesToRead (Array of Strings): String(s) representing the object type(s) this you wantsto read. See the OBJECT_TYPE_* constants for possible values.</li>
<li>onCompletion (Function): Function to be called when the operation completes. The function will receive a single object as parameter, with the following properties:<ul>
<li>success (Boolean): A Boolean value that indicates whether the user responded to the prompt (if any). This value does not indicate whether permission was actually granted. This parameter is <code>False</code> if the user canceled the prompt without selecting permissions; otherwise, <code>True</code>.</li>
<li>errorDomain (String): The error domain; only exists if there was an error.</li>
<li>errorCode (Number): The error code; only exists if there was an error.</li>
<li>errorMessage (String): The error message; only exists if there was an error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>&lt;Number&gt; getBloodType()</h3>
<p>Reads the user's blood type from the HealthKit store. See the BLOODTYPE_* constants for possible return values. Note that the return value will be <code>undefined</code> if an error occurs.</p>
<h3>&lt;Date&gt; getDateOfBirth()</h3>
<p>Reads the user's date of birth from the HealthKit store. Note that the return value will be <code>undefined</code> if an error occurs.</p>
<h3>&lt;void&gt; deleteObject(params)</h3>
<p>Deletes the specified object from the HealthKit store. Your app can delete only those objects that it has previously saved to the HealthKit database. If the user revokes sharing permission, you can no longer delete objects, either. This function operates asynchronously. As soon as the delete operation is finished, the specified callback function will be called.</p>
<ul>
<li>params (Object): A dictionary with the following parameters:<ul>
<li>object (<a href="object.html">Ti.Healthkit.Object</a>): The object to be deleted.</li>
<li>onCompletion (Function): Function to be called when the operation completes. The function will receive a single object as parameter, with the following properties:<ul>
<li>success (Boolean): This parameter contains if <code>True</code> the object was successfully deleted; otherwise, <code>False</code>.</li>
<li>errorDomain (String): The error domain; only exists if there was an error.</li>
<li>errorCode (Number): The error code; only exists if there was an error.</li>
<li>errorMessage (String): The error message; only exists if there was an error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>&lt;void&gt; saveObjects(params)</h3>
<p>Saves an array of objects to the HealthKit store. This function operates asynchronously. As soon as the save operation is finished, the specified callback function will be called.</p>
<p>If your app has not requested permission to share the object's data type, the method fails with an ERROR_CODE_AUTHORIZATION_NOT_DETERMINED error. If your app has been denied permission to save the object's data type, it fails with an ERROR_CODE_AUTHORIZATION_DENIED error. Saving an object with the same unique identifier as an object already in the HealthKit store fails with an ERROR_CODE_INVALID_ARGUMENT error. When saving multiple objects, if any object cannot be saved, none of them are saved.</p>
<p>Saving an object to the HealthKit store sets the source property for the stored object to an HKSource instance for the saving app. This value is available only after the object is retrieved from the HealthKit store. The original object is not changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>params (Object): A dictionary with the following parameters:<ul>
<li>objects (Array of <a href="object.html">Ti.Healthkit.Object</a> objects): The objects to be saved.</li>
<li>onCompletion (Function): Function to be called when the operation completes. The function will receive a single object as parameter, with the following properties:<ul>
<li>success (Boolean): This parameter contains <code>True</code> if the object was successfully saved to the HealthKit store; otherwise, <code>False</code>.</li>
<li>errorDomain (String): The error domain; only exists if there was an error.</li>

</ul>
<h3>&lt;void&gt; addSamplesToWorkout(params)</h3>
<p>Associates the provided samples with the workout.</p>
<p>This is an asynchronous function. As soon as the add-samples operation is finished, the provided callback function is called.</p>
<p>You must save the workout to the HealthKit store before you can add any samples to it. You can save the samples before calling this function, but doing so is not required. This function automatically saves any unsaved samples when it successfully adds them to the workout.</p>
<ul>
<li>params (Object): A dictionary with the following parameters:<ul>
<li>samples (Array of <a href="categorySample.html">Ti.Healthkit.CategorySample</a> or <a href="quantitySample.html">Ti.Healthkit.QuantitySample</a> objects): The samples to be added to the workout.</li>
<li>workout (<a href="workout.html">Ti.Healthkit.Workout</a>): The workout you are adding samples to.</li>
<li>onCompletion (Function): Function to be called when the operation completes. The function will receive a single object as parameter, with the following properties:<ul>
