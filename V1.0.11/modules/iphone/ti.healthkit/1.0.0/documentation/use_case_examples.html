<h1>Ti.Healthkit Module Use Case Examples</h1>
<p>Throughout these examples we assume that the app loads the Ti.Healthkit Module
into the <code>TiHealthkit</code> variable like so:</p>
<pre><code>TiHealthkit = require('ti.healthkit');
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: These examples may not show complete code that can be exacuted as is.
Please see the example app in the <code>example</code> folder for complete, runnable code.
The example app also includes the <code>Entitlements.plist</code> file, which is a
prerequisite to using any HealthKit related functionality.</p>
<h2>Verifying the Availability of Health Data</h2>
<p>Health data is not available on every iOS device. Before attempting to use
any HealthKit related functionality, verify that the app is running on a device
where health data is available:</p>
<pre><code>if (TiHealthkit.isHealthDataAvailable === false) {
    alert('Health data is not available on this device!');
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Requesting Authorization</h2>
<p>The primary function of HealthKit is to act as a data store. Due to the
sensitive nature of the data, the app will need to request authorization
before it can read/write data from/into the data store. This authorization
must be requested separately for each data type the app is interested in, and
it must be requested separately for reading and sharing (writing).</p>
<p>The following code requests read authorization for height, weight and heart
rate measurements, and share (write) authorization for heart rate measurements.</p>
<pre><code>var typesToRead = [
    TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_HEIGHT,
    TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_BODY_MASS,
    TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_HEART_RATE
];
var typesToShare = [
    TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_HEART_RATE
];
TiHealthkit.requestAuthorization({
    typesToRead: typesToRead,
    typesToShare: typesToShare,
    onCompletion: function(e) {
        if (e.success) {
            // The user completed the authorization process. Does not
            // mean that the authorization request was actually granted!
        } else {
            // The user cancelled the authorization prompt.
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>
<h2>Verifying Authorization Status</h2>
<p>The <code>onCompletion</code> callback of the <code>requestAuthorization</code> function (see above)
only tells reports whether the user completed the authorization process, not
whether the authorization request was actually granted.</p>
<p>The following code can be used to determine the authorization status of the app
for heart rate measurements:</p>
<pre><code>switch (TiHealthkit.getAuthorizationStatusForType(TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_HEART_RATE)) {
    case TiHealthkit.AUTH_STATUS_SHARING_AUTHORIZED:
        // The user granted the app's request to share heart rate measurements.
        break;
    case TiHealthkit.AUTH_STATUS_SHARING_DENIED:
        // The user denied the app's request to share heart rate measurements.
        break;
    case TiHealthkit.AUTH_STATUS_SHARING_NOT_DETERMINED:
        // The user has't yet granted the app's request to share heart rate measurements but hasn't denied it either.
}
</code></pre>
<p>Use the other <code>OBJECT_TYPE_*</code> constants to determine the authorization status
of the app for other type of measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that it is not possible to determine whether the app has read access
to a particular type of data in the HealthKit store. This is an intentional
limitation enforced by the native API to ensure confidentiality of sensitive
information -- the apps will not be able to distinguish between missing data
and the user denying read access.</p>
<h2>Accessing the User's Date of Birth, Gender, and Blood Type</h2>
<p>Most of the data in the HealthKit data store can be accessed by executing
queries. The user's birth date, gender, and blood type are exceptions -- these
data can be accessed using dedicated properties on the module object:</p>
<pre><code>var dob = TiHealthkit.userDateOfBirth;
var gender = TiHealthkit.userBiologicalSex;
var bloodType = TiHealthkit.userBloodType;
</code></pre>
<h2>Creating and Interpreting Quantities</h2>
<p>A quantity is a numerical value combined with a unit of measurement, such as
"2 miles", "100 calories", or "25 grams". Most of the entries in the HealthKit
data store will have one or more quantities associated with them. For example,
a workout entry might have a "distance" quantity associated with it, and a food
entry might have a "protein content" quantity.</p>
<p>The following code creates a quantity that represents 2 miles:</p>
<pre><code>var twoMiles = TiHealthkit.createQuantity(2, TiHealthkit.createUnit('mi'));
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>twoMiles</code> variable is now a <a href="quantity.html">Ti.Healthkit.Quantity</a> object.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/HealthKit/Reference/HKUnit_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/HKUnit/unitFromString:">native documentation</a> for the rules of creating
a valid unit string that can be used with the <code>createUnit</code> function.</p>
<p>After it's created, the quantity object is <em>not</em> tied to a single unit -- its
value can be retrieved in any compatible unit. For example, the value of the
above created <code>twoMiles</code> quantity can be retrieved in feet or kilometers because
miles, feet, and kilometers are all units for length measurement:</p>
<pre><code>var twoMilesInFeet = twoMiles.valueForUnit(TiHealthkit.createUnit('ft'));
var twoMilesInKilometers = twoMiles.valueForUnit(TiHealthkit.createUnit('km'));
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>twoMilesInFeet</code> and <code>twoMilesInKilometers</code> variables are floating point
numbers.</p>
<h2>Adding Weight and Height Measurements to the Data Store</h2>
<p>One of the basic pieces of data an app can store in the HealthKit data store
is the user's weight and height:</p>
<pre><code>var timestamp = new Date();

var poundUnit = TiHealthkit.createUnit('lb');
var weightQuantity = TiHealthkit.createQuantity(200, poundUnit);
var weightSample = TiHealthkit.createQuantitySample({
    type: TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_BODY_MASS,
    quantity: weightQuantity,
    startDate: timestamp,
    endDate: timestamp
});

var feetUnit = TiHealthkit.createUnit('ft');
var heightQuantity = TiHealthkit.createQuantity(6, feetUnit);
var heightSample = TiHealthkit.createQuantitySample({
    type: TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_HEIGHT,
    quantity: heightQuantity,
    startDate: timestamp,
    endDate: timestamp
});

TiHealthkit.saveObjects({
    objects: [ weightSample, heightSample ],
    onCompletion: function(e) {
        if (e.success) {
            // Weight sample was added.
        } else {
            // Weight sample was not added -- missing authorization?
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>Other quantity samples such as body fat percentage, lean body mass,
or heart rate can be stored in similar manner by creating the appropriate
quantity and quantity sample objects using the corresponding units and type
constants.</p>
<h2>Retrieving Weight Measurements from the Data Store</h2>
<p>To retrieve weight measurements (or most other types of data) from the
data store, you create and execute a query:</p>
<pre><code>var query = TiHealthkit.createObjectQuery({
                type: TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_BODY_MASS,
                onCompletion: function(e) {
                    // The retrieved objects are in the e.results array.
                }
            });
TiHealthkit.executeQuery(query);
</code></pre>
<h2>Retrieving Height Measurements created by Your App</h2>
<p>You can limit the objects returned by a query to those that meet certain
critaria by adding a filter to the query. For example, to retrieve only those
height measurements that were added by your app, you first create a source
filter, attach it to the query, and then execute the query:</p>
<pre><code>var sourceFilter = TiHealthkit.createFilterForObjects({
                sources: [ TiHealthkit.defaultSource ]
            });
var query = TiHealthkit.createObjectQuery({
                type: TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_HEIGHT,
                filter: sourceFilter,
                onCompletion: function(e) {
                    // The retrieved objects are in the e.results array.
                }
            });
TiHealthkit.executeQuery(query);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>TiHealthkit.defaultSource</code> property contains the <code>Ti.Healthkit.Source</code>
object that corresponds to your app.</p>
<h2>Adding a Workout Entry to the Data Store</h2>
<p>HealthKit uses workouts to track a wide range of activities. The following
example adds a workout entry for a running session that lasted for 30 minutes,
covered a distance of 4 miles, and burned 350 (kilo)calories:</p>
<pre><code>var energyBurned = TiHealthkit.createQuantity(350,  TiHealthkit.createUnit('kcal'));
var distanceCovered = TiHealthkit.createQuantity(4, TiHealthkit.createUnit('mi'));
var workout = TiHealthkit.createWorkout({
    type: TiHealthkit.WORKOUT_ACTIVITY_TYPE_RUNNING,
    startDate: new Date(2015, 06, 15, 16, 25),
    endDate: new Date(2015, 06, 15, 16, 55),
    duration: 1800,
    totalDistance: distanceCovered,
    totalEnergyBurned: energyBurned
});
TiHealthkit.saveObjects({
    objects: [ workout ],
    onCompletion: function(e) {
        // e.success will be True if the workout was added.
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>Use the other <code>WORKOUT_ACTIVITY_TYPE_*</code> constants to create workout entries for
activities other than running.</p>
<h2>Creating a Correlation to Capture Blood Pressure Data</h2>
<p>Correlations are used to group multiple samples together. For example, all the
samples describing the nutrition content (fat, protein, sugar, vitamins, etc) of
a meal can be grouped into a correlation. The following example creates a
correlation object that groups together the systolic and diastolic values
of a blood pressure measurement:</p>
<pre><code>var timestamp = new Date();
var mmHg = TiHealthkit.createUnit('mmHg');

var systolic = TiHealthkit.createQuantitySample({
    type: TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_BLOOD_PRESSURE_SYSTOLIC,
    quantity: TiHealthkit.createQuantity(118, mmHg),
    startDate: timestamp,
    endDate: timestamp
});
var diastolic = TiHealthkit.createQuantitySample({
    type: TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_BLOOD_PRESSURE_DIASTOLIC,
    quantity: TiHealthkit.createQuantity(76, mmHg),
    startDate: timestamp,
    endDate: timestamp
});
var correlation = TiHealthkit.createCorrelation({
    type: TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_CORRELATION_BLOOD_PRESSURE,
    startDate: timestamp,
    endDate: timestamp,
    objects: [ systolic, diastolic ]
});

TiHealthkit.saveObjects({
    objects: [ correlation ],
    onCompletion: function(e) {
        // e.success will be True if the correlation was added.
    }
});
</code></pre>
<h2>Retrieving Correlation Entries Indicating High Blood Pressure</h2>
<p>Use a correlation query with a sample filter to retrieve correlations that
contain a sample that meets certain criteria. For example, the following code
retrieves those correlations that include a systolic blood pressure sample, and
only if that sample has a quantity higher than 120mmHg:</p>
<pre><code>var mmHg = TiHealthkit.createUnit('mmHg');

var sampleFilters = {};
sampleFilters[TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_BLOOD_PRESSURE_SYSTOLIC] =
                TiHealthkit.createFilterForQuantitySamples({
                    operator: TiHealthkit.FILTER_OPERATOR_GREATER_THAN,
                    quantity: TiHealthkit.createQuantity(120, mmHg)
                });

var query = TiHealthkit.createCorrelationQuery({
    type: TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_CORRELATION_BLOOD_PRESSURE,
    sampleFilters: sampleFilters,
    onCompletion: function(e) {
        // The retrieved objects are in the e.results array.
    }
});
TiHealthkit.executeQuery(query);
</code></pre>
<h2>Deleting Entries from the Data Store</h2>
<p>The <code>TiHealthkit.deleteObject</code> function can be used to delete entries from
the HealthKit data store:</p>
<pre><code>TiHealthkit.deleteObject({
    object: healthKitObject,
    onCompletion: function(e) {
        // e.success will be True if the correlation was successfully deleted.
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>Note that an app can only delete those entries that it created, not the entries
created by other apps. Also, the user may revoke the sharing permission after
an app created an entry in the data store, in which case the app will not be
able to delete even its own entries.</p>
<h2>Retrieving New Data Store Entries As They Are Created</h2>
<p>Observer queries can run in the background and notify the app when an entry
matching certain criteria is added or removed from the data store. An anchored
query can be used to retrieve only the newly added entries:</p>
<pre><code>var anchor;

var anchoredQuery = TiHealthkit.createObjectQuery({
    type: TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_BODY_FAT_PERCENTAGE,
    anchor: anchor, // will be undefined during first execution
    onCompletion: function(e) {
        anchor = e.anchor; // next execution will start where this one finished

        // e.results contains only the newly added entries
});

var observerQuery = TiHealthkit.createObserverQuery({
    type: TiHealthkit.OBJECT_TYPE_BODY_FAT_PERCENTAGE,
    onUpdate: function(e) {
        TiHealthkit.executeQuery(anchoredQuery);
    }
});

TiHealthkit.executeQuery(observerQuery);
</code></pre>
