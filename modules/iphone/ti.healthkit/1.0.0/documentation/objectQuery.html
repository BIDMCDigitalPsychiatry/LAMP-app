<h1>Ti.Healthkit.ObjectQuery</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Object queries provide an easy way to search for new data in the HealthKit store. Object queries return an anchor value that corresponds to the last sample received by that query. Subsequent queries can use this anchor to restrict their results to only samples saved after the sample corresponding to the anchor.</p>
